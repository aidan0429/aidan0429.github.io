                <h3>Who are we designing websites for?</h3>
                <p>When designing websites, we must consider creating the website
                    for all potential users. This includes people with disabilities, cultural differences,
                    device differences, and differing levels of digital experience.

                <p>A main role of Universal Design is making sure that no matter where in the world you live, you have access 
                    to the same usage as everyone else. This means considering different levels of internet access, 
                    connectivity, internet speeds, and device types when building for Universal Design.

                <p>The most important part of Universal Design is making sure that all users are included.
                    This means considering all barriers that users may face, and ensuring 
                    that there are solutions for these barriers.

            <p>In conclusion, Universal Design is essential for ensuring that all users are able to

                ensure that no one is excluded and that everyone has the same level of 
                accessibility across the web.
